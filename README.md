## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I had completed harder challenges then this one, in the sense that I created more challenging projects for 
my personal portfolio. But still this challenge was a great exercise. I build this using react and sass, so 
got good practice. There were still some brand new thing that I learned. And the main thing that I got to learn
was the CSS property background position and size. I did knew these properties before hand but I got to go deeper
into these properties by building this project. Before I only used either 
background-size: cover 
or 
background-size: contain. 

Thus, building this project made me get deeper into these properties and I started manipulating background image
size by using rems. Also, I learned a how to position background images using background-position; which was 
completely new to me.


### Continued development

I topics I want to learn in future projects is to learn more about typography and how to layout text responsivley 
across different viewports. I admit I didn't really layout the texts in the manner was I was supposed to in this challenge.


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size):
This was helpful is get a good grasp of how to layout images in the background.

- [resource 2]('Other people's solution'):
I was actually stucked on how to layout the background image of the header. So looking into other people's code was 
really helpful. I didn't checkout their github but opened their project and then checkout their
code using the dev tools (which is more helpful IMO). The code was actually background-position: center center;

- [resource 3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position):
Another MDN article, this time for background-position. Laying out the images was the hardest challenge for me.

## Acknowledgments

As mentioned in Useful resources, I did look up on someone's project to figure out how to layout the
background image of the header. But I don't remember the name(username) and honeslty I think I would be wasting time
to look up that particular solutions in the sea of all other solutions. So, I'll remmeber the particular 
project builder in the future. But still, thank you for this particular code background-position: center center.
Other than that, I would like to thank MDN and the Mozilla community in general for all their amazing resources.
